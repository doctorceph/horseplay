Horseplay
=========

Tools for horses. A mod for Minecraft Forge, inspired by [Forestry](http://forestry.sengir.net/wiki.new/doku.php).

Summary
-------

Ever wondered why your character in modded Minecraft is able to build a [holographic storage device](http://ae-mod.info/Spatial-Containment-Structure/), or a [portal into another dimension](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Nether_portal), but is unable to create a saddle? Due to this strange ineptitude with leather, your character is left to rely on the off-chance that somebody left one lying around in a chest filled with zombies, or has one for sale at the local village.

Ever wondered how you can analyse the very genome of the bees, trees and butterflies in the air around you - but have no idea how fast your horse is?

Horseplay is here to help you answer these burning questions that you never had until you just read them then.
